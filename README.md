## Release History

### 1.0 (1), July 12, 2022

First early alpha release. You can create accounts and fill the account slots with output descriptors. Each slot can generate a unique request for an output descriptor that Seed Tool 1.6 (60) can respond to.

Known issue: The button for Settings (gear icon) currently does nothing.
